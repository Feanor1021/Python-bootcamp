    "In C and python there is a thing called function pointers. If you want to call an function you have to know at what addres it is. Function pointers keep these addresses in them and you can call them in your code when ever you want. In C and Python function names (or method's) are function pointers. If you don't put braces after the function name it will give you some address which function is started. In C you can see these things but in python all the pointers Abstracted very hardly and you can't see them as good as in C. Anyway lets keep track our subject with python. We said that functions or methods name are function pointers and they are keep the begining of the function addres. You can change pointers values with assigning them to another addresses and if you do that you can't reach the actual function anymore. It is a big problem, you are losing an for entire of the run time. To prevent this some of the languages have private and public keyword. If it is private than you can't change it's function pointer's values. But if is not you may. To prevent this problem python has nothing.\n",
    "We don't have any keyword to thell the interpreter \"don't change this function pointer's value it is so important\". But the python community has settled on use \"_\" if you want to say to devs it should be private and even it is beginning with \"_\" you can still change them.\n",
